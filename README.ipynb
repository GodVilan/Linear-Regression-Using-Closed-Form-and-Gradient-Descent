    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** implemented in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closed-form solution** using the Normal Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient Descent** optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta := \\theta - \\eta \\cdot \\frac{2}{m} X^T (X\\theta - y)\n",

    "Synthetic data is generated based on:\n",

    "## Steps Performed\n",
    "1. **Generate Dataset**\n",
    "   - 200 samples with x ∈ [0,5] and Gaussian noise.\n",
    "2. **Closed-form Solution**\n",
    "   - Compute parameters using the Normal Equation.\n",
    "3. **Gradient Descent**\n",
    "   - Initialize θ = [0, 0], use learning rate 0.05, run for 1000 iterations.\n",
    "   - Plot loss curve to verify convergence.\n",
    "4. **Visualization**\n",
    "   - Plot raw data points.\n",
    "   - Plot fitted line from both Closed-form and GD.\n",
    "5. **Comparison**\n",
    "   - Report both solutions (intercept & slope).\n",
    "   - Verify GD converges to the same solution as closed-form.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "- **Closed-form Solution:**  \n",
    "  Intercept ≈ 3, Slope ≈ 4  \n",
    "- **Gradient Descent:**  \n",
    "  Intercept ≈ 3, Slope ≈ 4 (after 1000 iterations)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Descent solution converged very close to the closed-form result, confirming correctness.\n",
